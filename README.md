### React Portfolio

## Fresh Code
This is a rebuild of my portfolio, moving the framework from jQuery to React. Also this will be built on a Node.js express server, with a Mongo database. The layout and styles will be similar to the previous portfolio, with some added twists!

## What's new?
I am adding the following features:
 - tabs to sort portfolio items into groups
 - an add item form
 - API routes to get portfolio items from DB
 - more!

### React Portfolio

## Fresh Code
This is a rebuild of my portfolio, moving the framework from jQuery to React. Components will be modular so the flow for adding additional items to the porfolio will be easier. Will be built on a Node.js express server. The layout and styles will be similar to the previous portfolio, with some added twists!

## What's new?
I am adding the following features:
 - React! No more jQuery here.
 - depoyment other than github pages
 - tabs to sort portfolio items into groups
 - an add item form
 - API routes to get portfolio items from DB
 
 ## Why?
I wanted to make my portfolio easier to update, and get some more practice working with react.
